**designing the brushless motor: https://www.tinkercad.com/things/eYAocFP9nYe-tremendous-crift/editel
 1-i used the tinkercad simulator: https://www.tinkercad.com
2-the Components i used: 
-Arduino uno
-DC motor
-breadboard
-battery
3-first i connected the outouts of DC motors to A&B of the breadboard (polarity doesn't matter)
4-secend i connected each +&- of the battery to the -&+ of the breadboard respectively 
5-i connected the brown cable from pin 3 on breadboard to the GND pin on arduino 
6-connected the yellow cable to the digital pin 12 from digital pin 1
7-programming arduino on arduino IDE using this code ()
