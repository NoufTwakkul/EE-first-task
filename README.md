**designing the brushless motor: https://www.tinkercad.com/things/eYAocFP9nYe-tremendous-crift/editel
 1-i used the tinkercad simulator: https://www.tinkercad.com
2-the Components i used: 
-Arduino uno
-DC motor
-breadboard
-battery
3-first i connected the outouts of DC motors to A&B of the breadboard (polarity doesn't matter)
4-secend i connected each +&- of the battery to the -&+ of the breadboard respectively 
5-i connected the brown cable from pin 3 on breadboard to the GND pin on arduino 
6-connected the yellow cable to the digital pin 12 from digital pin 1
7-programming arduino on arduino IDE using this code ()


**designing the servo motor: https://www.tinkercad.com/things/dn9xzdWBlDF-amazing-migelo-wluff/editel
1-i used the tinkercad simulator: https://www.tinkercad.com
2-the Components i used: 
-micro servo 
-Arduino uno
-breadboard
3-first i connected the signal pin (greem cable) of the micro servo to the D9 pin of arduino 
4-secendly i connected the power pin (red cable) of the micro servo to the 5V pin of arduino 
5-thirdlly i connected the ground pin (black cable) of the micro servo to the digital -1 pin of breadboard
6-lastly i connected the SCL pin (black cable) of the arduino to the digital -5 pin of breadboard
